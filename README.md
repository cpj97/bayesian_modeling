# Understanding the Structural Drivers of Violence in Colombia: A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach

This research project explores the relationship between structural development indicators and security outcomes
across Colombian municipalities using a hierarchical Bayesian model. By analyzing data from the Modern Cities
Index (ICM) for the period 2010â€“2022, the model accounts for the nested structure of municipalities within
departments and allows both baseline levels of violence and the effects of key predictors to vary by region. While
global trends already show heterogeneous results for each predictor, department-level estimates further display
detailed regional heterogeneity, underscoring the need for context-sensitive analysis. The findings highlight the utility
of Bayesian methods for policy design and suggest that effective violence reduction strategies must be tailored to the
specific institutional and historical conditions of each region.
